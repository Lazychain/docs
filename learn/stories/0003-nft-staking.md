## User Scenarios

### Feature: User NFT Staking

#### Scenario 1: Successful Staking with NFT on List

Title: User successfully stakes NFT when it's on the list

```gherkin
Given the user is logged in
And the user's NFT is on the staking list
When the user selects a staking period
And the user executes the staking and pays the fees
Then the staking is successfully applied to the NFT
And the user is redirected back to the NFT list for potential further staking
```

#### Scenario 2: NFT Not on List - Exit Flow

Title: User exits flow when NFT is not on the staking list

```gherkin
Given the user is logged in
And the user's NFT is not on the staking list
When the user attempts to stake the NFT
Then the user is notified that the NFT is not eligible for staking
And the staking flow is exited
And the user is not prompted for staking period or fees
```

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Stakings (Edge Case)

Title: User can stake multiple times with NFT on the list

```gherkin
Given the user is logged in
And the user's NFT is on the staking list
When the user selects a staking period and executes the staking, paying the fees
And the user again selects a staking period for the same NFT and executes the staking, paying the fees
Then both stakings are successfully applied to the NFT
And the user is redirected back to the NFT list after each staking
And the NFT's updated staking status is reflected
```
